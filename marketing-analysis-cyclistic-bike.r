Therefore, my marketing analyst team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the exibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\nCyclistic’s nance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more protable than casual riders. Although the pricing exibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\nMoreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to beer understand how annual members and casual riders dier, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.\n\n**Problem:** the annual members are much more profitable than casual riders\n\n**Solution:** maximize the number of annual members by converting casual users into members\n\n**Business Purpose:** The project aims to analyze Cyclistic's historical trip data between 2019 and 2020 to identify trends of how Cyclistic users use bike-share service differently. Accordingly, the marketing team will design a new marketing strategy based on the data analysing report, which will be presented to the executive team. \n\nStakeholders: \n* Executive team member\n* Lily Moreno - Marketing Director\n* Cyclistic marketing analytics team\n\n## PREPARE PHASE\n\n**Data Source:**\nThe data sources are collected from the Cyclistic trip data (03/2019 - 04/2020) https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. The data is about Cyclistic's historical trip data from 2019-2020, involving 3,876,042 trips. The data is stored in CSV format with 4 spreadsheets, covering from 04/2019 - 03/2020.\n\nThis is the public data which has been provided by Motivate International Inc.; hence, the data is real, original from bike-share data in Chicago, also objective, unbiased and credible. The data source is also comprehensive, accurate and relevant to address and solve our business problem because it has all the ride information, including user types, date, time and bike-share stations to analyse customer preferences of using bike-share. \n\nTo evaluate the data’s credibility and integrity in detail, we can assess the most data aspects: \n\n* Reliable: Generally, the data is reliable because it was complied from the actual and trustworthy source, Motivate International Inc., with the license.\n* Original: This is original data, which includes real-time historical bike-share trip data from actual customers in Chicago. \n* Comprehensive: The data is comprehensive because it includes about the rides taken by customers, with important information about user types, date, time, trip duration and station names. \n* Current: The data is not very current since it’s from 2019 to 2020; but it’s not outdated either.\n* Cited: The data is cited because it’s from Divvy bicycle sharing service, operated by Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC (“Bikeshare”) and made available by Motivate International Inc. \n\nMoreover, it’s important to address the data-privacy issues present in the licence under which the data has been available to public. It’s based on Chicago’ regulatory data privacy policy; thus, it’s not permitted to use customers’ personal information such as the credit card information.\n\nThe spreadsheets are organised in a wide format, where each row represents one specific ride and the column has different attributes of the ride, which include the ride ID, bike types, timestamps, departed and arrived station names, coordinates for latitudes and longitudes and user types categorised into member and casual user.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Loading

Annual members have greater number of rides during the week and months, and account for 62% of total number of users. They steadily take rides during the week, however, their number of rides fluctuate significantly during the year. It demonstrates that the demand increases dramatically from April to October, and decrease gradually for the rest of the year. However, annual members take quite short rides based on average trip duration. In addition, members have the highest traffic at 17:00 on weekdays, and at 15:00 on weekends. It suggests that customer generally use bike-share service for coming back to work.\n\nSimilarly, casual customers take more rides at 17:00 on weekdays which is the rush hour.

They take more rides on weekends, after week, and on noon and afternoon for entertainment, exercise or relaxation. \n* Tourists and Vistors: the segment represents individuals who are not the residents of Chicago, and are visting the city for tourism or business purposes. They use bike-share service to go through popular destinations within the city.

They could use bike-share more frequent and for multiple purposes than tourists and visitors. The analysis indicates that casual users are more likely to use bike-share on the weekends, and have long trip duration around 60 minutes to 160 minutes on average, implying that they use bikes for leisure and exercise activites. Cyclistic could design new marketing strategy targeting local casual customers by introducing them the cost-effectiveness of annual membership both day-to-day and leisure activities around Chicago. Thus, it motivates casual users to take bike-share as daily transportation for commuting. Moreover, the marketing strategy should emphasize the advantage of limited accsess during peak leisure times and rush hours, thus, encouraging casual customers to join membership for daily usage. Overally, number of rides for both user types fluctuates notably during the year, which has a significant increase in ride volumes from Arpil to October and remain stable for rest of the year. Therefore, special marketing campains or special deals are essential and important for engaging customers to join annual membership. \n\nFirstly, Cyclistic should have marketing campaigns aiming to target customers, which is local casual users. The marketing campaigns could focus on showing the membership's benefits and advantages, and cost-effectiveness for annual membership, which customers could use bike-share service for both day-to-day and recreational activities at lower cost. The campaigns could take place during Summer and Fall months, where there is a peak in casual customers, accompanied with outdoor advertising at top staions such as Streeter Dr & Grand Ave and Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, etc., where casual riders primarily start and end the trips. Cyclistic could offer special deals for new members, including a 3-day free trial, special discount when members invite friends to join membership, and exclusive benefits for members during peak season. Developing seasonal campaigns supports  to emphasize the advantages of using Cyclistic bikes during the Summer and Fall.\n\nSecondly, Cyclistic could optimize docking station practices at top popular stations during the peak summer season due to an increased demand of bike-share. In addition, pricing plans' limit should be highlighted, so customers could compare and consider the benefits of being Cyclistic's member. \n\nNext, Cyclistic could provide ride challenges with rewards to encourage customers to highly engage and use bikes. Casual customers are usually use bikes for leisure and exercise purposes, thus, the challenge could focus on health and well-being of customers. Morevoer, Cyclistic could give information about total ride length of user in 1 month and how many calories users burn per day, per week and per month. Therefore, it could attract more potential casual customers to join the annual membership.\nThirdly, Cyclistic should collab with local business and tourism companies within Chicago, including museums, zoos, aquariums and hotels, etc., and provide exclusive perks, packages and special discounts for new members, who join membership for daily usage. \n\nFinally, the marketing campaigns should be took place in digital platforms to target casual customers and gain high engagement for the personalized advertising campaigns during the peak season. The campaigns could be posted on social media, including Instagram, Facebook and Youtube, and emphasized on cost-effectiveness and membership benefits. Also, Cyclistic should encourage customers to share their experiences and feedback on digital media, thus, increasing sales through word-of-mouth. The feedbacks need to be updated often to understand their experiences and satisfaction with Cyclistic bikes and stations for more improvement. ","metadata":{}}]}
